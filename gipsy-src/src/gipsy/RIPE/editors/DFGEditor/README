1. Installation:

The Graphical Editor is a stand-alone graphic editor application
that is separated into 2 divisions: the graphic tools and its
customization files. This package contains all 8 customization files.
The graphic tools including: 

  dot, a layout tool for graphic editor.
  lefty, a two-view graphical editor for technical picture.
	
The graphic tools are included in GraphViz pakage, which provides
a set of graph drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows (win32). The GraphViz
package can be download from AT&T Labs - Research website
(http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html).

The Graphical Editor uses LEFTYPATH environment variable. LEFTYPATH is
a colon-separated list of directories. When the Graphical Editor tries to
start up a process or to open a file, it searches that path first,
then the standard PATH variable.
