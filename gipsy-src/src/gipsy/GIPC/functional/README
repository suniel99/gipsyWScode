Functional Languages Supported in GIPSY
---------------------------------------

TODO

Note, while there is a provision to have
Functional Langauge compilers in this
directory, the framwork and its interface
have not been explioitly defined though
they will be pretty close to the
imperative language compilers framework.

I'll work on this later when I have time,
if you feel like picking it up, go straight
ahead. Use 'imperative' and 'intesional'
packages as examples, define IFunctionalCompiler,
and get the ball rolling.
