**************************************************************

1. Composition:

The zip file, DFGAnalyzer.zip, contains 16 java files which compose a stand alone java application. Those 16 files fall into 3 divisions: the stub, the code generator and the parser. As well, the zip file contains the grammar file, DFGParser.jjt.

* the stub including:
  ParserFacet.java, the facet layer.
  DFGAnalyzer.java, the entry class of the whole application.

  Those 2 files are implemented totally manually, of course no compiler construction tools support generating them.

* the code generator including:
  LCGenerator.java, the Lucid code generator.

* the parser including:
  Other *.java files, the parser code generated by JavaCC/JJTree, no more customization to this file.

2. Usage:

* Actually, all the files included in the zip file compose a stand alone java application. After compiling with the command 'javac *.java', you can run this java application to get a Lucid code.

However, if you want to start from the very beginning (only the jjt file), you have to install JavaCC/JJTree on your own platform. Go to https://javacc.dev.java.net/, you can free download the application. After installation, be sure to copy the applications javacc and jjtree into your working directory.

NOTE: some generated java files will be re-freshed whenever you start JavaCC or JJTree, while some won't. JavaCC/JJTree will check if there is such file existing under current working directory. This is very usful for those customizable java files. We don't have to change them every time after we invoke JavaCC/JJTree.

* How to run this application
This java application's name is DFGAnalyzer. Java VM will give you prompt if you didn't give any parameter.
The usage of the application is: 
java DFGAnalyzer testingFilename
The default output will be LCtestout1.ttt in allfile folder.
